I'm just a guy who likes not being spied on by microsoft, google or else. So I forced myself to use linux, which forced me to learn how to code, which made me more aware of what was going on in my operating system, which forced me to install archlinux, which forced me to learn how to code better, etc. <br>
*(Didn't quite go like that, I start by printing `Hello World` in python on my father's mac)* <br>

# Things that you should Keep in mind while browsing this site:
- I am completely open to criticism regarding everything that I post/say(you can contact me [here](https://www.ferrry.tk/about/#contact-me)). Keep in mind, I am open to criticism, _not insults_, but if you have some really good insults still [email](https://www.ferrry.tk/about/#contact-me) them to me.
- This blog is not for posting things that I think people could find useful, it's more of a `/var/log` of what I do, and it casually happens to be on the World Wide Web, so you might find posts regarding many topics, not just technology, and some of them might just be guides that I upload just to know where to go if I encounter a certain problem again.
- **Don't take what I say as the truth**. I have no real title of study in the IT field, everything I know amounts to what I learned over the years on the internet(formus, guides, doumentation, IRC, etc.). I am not responsible if you mess something up while following a guide/everything else on this blog it's not my fault. **This should be something you always keep in mind while browsing/following guides on the internet.**
