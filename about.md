I'm just a guy who likes not being spied on by microsoft, google or else. So I forced myself to use linux, which forced me to learn how to code, which made me more aware of what is going on on my operating system, which forced me to install archlinux, which forced me to learn how to code better, etc. <br>
*(Didn't quite go like that, I start by printing "Hello World" in python on my father's mac)* <br>
