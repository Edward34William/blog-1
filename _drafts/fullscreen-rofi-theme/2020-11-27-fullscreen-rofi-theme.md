# Introduction

This is a writeup that I made to showcase that a riced linux desktop can look on par(if not better) than any other modern operating system's.  

## What is Rofi?

In this writeup I'm going to talk about [`rofi`](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi), from their github, "a window switcher, Application launcher and dmenu replacement".  
Most people just use rofi as an application launcher, but the default theme looks like it came straight from 2011.  
These are 2 themes that I hand picked from _the internet_ over the years, which I think are the best ones that I found so far.

[Rofi-Glass](https://gist.github.com/Ferryistaken/e0cf8e0850ae386d33580aa191b4ebad#file-rofi-glass-fullscreen-rasi) is a rofi theme which aims to be clean and minimal, to disrupt the thought that linux window manager setups can't look modern.
