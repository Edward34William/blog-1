## Terms used in this post
- Free ➜ Free doesn't mean free of charge, rather Free in a less materialistic way.
- Free Software ➜ Free Software as described by the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
- Open Source Software ➜ Software whose source code is available

# Software
- I believe in open source software, which doesn't have to be _free software_(as in how the [FSF](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) describes it). But to guarantee user freedom **every piece of code that runs on you pc must be public**.
- Why not Free Software then?
    - In a perfect world every software would fall under the category of free software, and while the idea of this perfect world is really appealing we need to acknowledge that we live in an imperfect world, where some companies might want their software to be ran only by people who bought the license, or maybe they don't want other people to change their software, and I think that leaving that choice to the developers is a good compromise between privacy and applicability in the real world from a commercial standpoint.
    - While the "[4 essential freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html#the-four-essential-freedoms)" don't directly specify that the software must be free, they do specify that anyone should have _"The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2)."_. Which could create a grey area regarding paid/subscription based software, where in some cases redistributing the software to anyone could be a problem. This doesn't apply to all paid/subscription based software, for example, Netflix could make the desktop/mobile client Open Source, while still keeping a subscription model, since in order to actually watch the content you need an account.

# Hardware
- I don't believe that hardware should be open source, **IF** every piece of software running on it _is_, else the company behind the hardware should make the project/schematics freely available, **so that the community can come up with open source alternatives to the proprietary software** without doing/doing less reverse engineering, **which would be legal in some cases**(for example [reverse engineering to guarantee interoperability within computer programs](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201)).

> In the U.S., Section 103(f) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) (17 USC § 1201 (f) - Reverse Engineering) specifically states that it is legal to reverse engineer and circumvent the protection to achieve interoperability between computer programs (such as information transfer between applications). Interoperability is defined in paragraph 4 of Section 103(f).

- I find disgusting that 99.9999999% of modern computing hardware has some form of proprietary software on it, ranging from [intel ME](https://www.wired.com/story/intel-management-engine-vulnerabilities-pcs-servers-iot/) to [whole operating systems](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/). And I really think that this problem(yes it's a problem ) doesn't have enough voice, but I really think that in the next years(2050 MAX) some major company will do something wrong and expose how bad this problem really is(more than Edward Snowden did). **Because since in our society technology rules us, we cannot be free if our technology isn't.** And for some reason, people don't realize this and don't think that this is a real problem.
