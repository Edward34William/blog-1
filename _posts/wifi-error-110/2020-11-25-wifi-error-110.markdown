# How to fix "probe failed with error -110" during boot on linux

## Specs
```yaml
Cpu: Ryzen 9 3900x
Motherboard: Aorus x570 Master
Gpu: MSI RTX 2080 S
Ram: Corsair Vengeance Pro RGB 2x32Gb
Linux Version: 5.9.10-zen1-1-zen
```

## The Error
When you boot your kernel will throw this error:
```shell_session
iwlwifi: probe of <wifi card> failed with error -110
```
And your wifi card won't be recognized, this is not because of a driver error and is **almost impossible to troubleshoot**, this is because this error is caused by Windows.
> Caused by dual booting Windows, no, it's not a joke

## What causes the error
This error is caused by Windows's `fast start` option, which basically hogs the wifi card and makes it so that the linux kernel cannot load the drivers for it.

## How to fix the error
To fix the error, simply turn off the `fast start` option in Windows, if this doesn't fix it, then it's a different error with the same error code.

There are 2 ways to turn off the `fast start` option:
1. Through Control Panel:  
    • Open Control Panel  
    • Choose `Power Options`  
    • Select `Choose what the power buttons do`  
    • Under `Shutdown Settings`, turn off the checkbox which says `Turn on fast startup`  
    • Click `Save Settings`  
2. Using the Command Prompt  
    • Start command prompt as root  
    • Type `powercfg -h off` and press Enter  

The next time you reboot, the Linux kernel should be able to start the wifi card correctly.
> After some updates Windows might turn fast start back on, just repeat this steps to turn it off again
