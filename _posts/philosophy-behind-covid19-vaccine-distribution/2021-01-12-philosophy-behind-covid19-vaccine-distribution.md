> Philosophy behind the Covid-19 vaccine distribution: is there a proper "scientific" or rational approach to this issue?

# The philosophical problem
Since at the time Covid-19 vaccine doses are limited, the world is faced with a problem: **who should the first doses go to?** Some say front line and **essential workers** and some say the **elderly**. Both choices have rational arguments behind them, but ultimately, in the US, the single state will decide who the vaccine will go to first.

## Elderly argument
The argument behind vaccinating the elderly first is that since they are the demographic which has a higher risk of death, vaccinating them first would greatly reduced the total deaths caused by Covid-19. Even though the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) knows this (as seen in [their report](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-11/COVID-04-Dooling.pdf)), they still suggest that vaccines should be given in this order: 
>"Health care workers and those in nursing homes will go first, followed by those 75 and older and front-line essential workers, followed by those 65 and older and other essential workers."

This order suggests that those 75 and older and front-line essential workers are at the same risk, but this is not the casae, since *the infection fatality rate for senior citizens is at least 10 times the rate for non-seniors.*

The CDC suggest to proceed in this order because elderly people in the US are usually whither, thus vaccinating them first would mean vaccinating more white people first. On top of that, essential and frontline workers are more racially and socioeconomically diverse.

If this is just or unjust is hard to decide. Should we vaccinate first the demographic with a higher risk of death? In a perfect world, yes, but there are other factors to take into account when deciding who should receive it first. For example old people are usually whiter because, according to the New York Times: *"Society is structured in a way that enables them to live longer. Instead of giving additional health benefits to those who already had more of them, we can start to level the playing field a bit."*

## Counter argument
Without deciding if it is right to take ethnicity into account while deciding who should get vaccined first, **Matt Yglesias** says that *"[talking about giving vaccines to essential workers first] you're not actually saving Black people's lives this way. You're opting for a strategy that leads to more Black deaths and more white deaths than the "vaccinate seniors first" strategy, but deciding that it's better for equity and this is what ethics requires."* He explains how in greater detail in his post on [his blog](https://www.slowboring.com/p/vaccinate-elderly). This is because so many senior citizens are going to die while you vaccinate frontline workers that the total number of black deaths will be higher than vaccinating old people first.

# Conclusion
While I understand that senior citizens are whiter in the US because of an imbalance of wealth between races originated from systematic racism, I don't think that in this case we should take vaccinating people first because of their ethnicity into account, simply because it will results in more total deaths. And as Matt Yglesias says, vaccinating elderly people first will results in less deaths for any ethnicity.
